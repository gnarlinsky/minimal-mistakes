### Q: ``set`` behavior
1. What is ``set1`` after executing these statements?  Why?
2. Can we definitively say what the result of ``set0.pop()`` would be? Why?
    {% highlight python %}
    >>> set0 = set(['hello', 'bye', 1, 2])
    >>> set1 = set0
    >>> set0.pop()
    {% endhighlight %}

### A:
1. If the result of ``set0.pop()`` is ``1``, then ``set1`` is ``set([2, 'bye', 'hello'])`` -- because, like lists, set assignment is by reference, not copy (i.e. a new object is NOT created)
2. The easy answer is, can't be sure.... More details: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9848693/set-popping-python">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9848693/set-popping-python</a>.
